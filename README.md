# Advent of Code 2020 - My Solutions
These are my <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020">Advent of Code (AoC)</a> puzzle solutions.

I'm not aiming to be the first of leaderboard but only play with puzzle and maybe write unittest for all puzzles.


# Install
I using Python 3.8.5

There is a requirements.txt file with all dependencies for re-create enviroment locally.

Commands to create enviroment are:

    -   virtualenv venv
    -   source venv/bin/activate
    -   pip install -r requirements.txt


# CONFIGURATION

All puzzle's data are stored into _data folder.

# RUN

Each puzzle is stored into folder with day name (eg: 1, 2, ... 24, 25).

To run designated puzzle, type the command:

    -   python 1/day_1.py
    -   python 2/day_2.py
    -   ...

Is possibile run also unittest with the command

    -   python 1/test_day_1.py
    -   python 2/test_day_2.py
    -   ....
